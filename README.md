### 1. How to Interact with the Artwork  
When the page loads, the code runs automatically. The circular pattern animation will start, creating an effect of expansion and contraction on the canvas. You can interact with the scene by slowly moving the mouse, and each click triggers a new firework effect, adding a dynamic rhythm to the overall animation.

### 2. Explanation of Personal Approach  
a) Choice of Personal Code Drivers 
In my personal code, I chose time and mouse interaction as the main drivers of the animation. Time controls the expansion and contraction of the circles, while mouse clicks trigger new firework effects, making the scene more colorful and vibrant.

b) Animated Properties and Differences from Team Members 
In my code, the main animation property is the expansion and contraction of circles. I adjust the circle's size to gradually grow and shrink over a set period. Additionally, with each mouse click, the code generates a firework effect at the click location, with random colors and positions, adding visual interest. This animation approach differs from another team member's, who used a User Input method.

c) Inspiration for the Animation
My animation is inspired by scenes of everyday fireworks displays, giving viewers a sense of rhythm and layering. I attempted to simulate the blooming effect of fireworks on the canvas through the expansion of various circles and colors, enhancing the dynamic quality of the code.

d) Technical Explanation
To achieve the expansion and contraction effect, I used JavaScript's `setInterval()` function, making the circle gradually increase or decrease in size at set intervals. The firework effect is realized through a particle system; particles generated by mouse clicks have lifespans, gradually disappearing to simulate the dispersal effect of fireworks. By combining of sin and frameCount, the circle could shake.

### 3. Technical Explanation of the Animation in My Personal Code
In my personal code, I implemented an animation driven primarily by two factors: time-based transformations and user interactions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the approach and the techniques used:

a)Animating Circle Expansion and Contraction:

Using setInterval() in JavaScript, I created an effect where circles expand and contract rhythmically. By adjusting the radius over time, the circles grow and shrink, producing a pulsating visual similar to a heartbeat or breathing effect.
The drawCircle() function in my code controls this effect. It takes parameters for radius, position, and color and draws multiple layers to create depth and visual interest.

b)Firework Effect with Mouse Clicks:

Each mouse click generates a "firework" effect using a particle system. This feature adds a sense of spontaneity and interaction.
When the user clicks, randomly colored particles appear at the cursor location, then disperse and fade away over time, simulating fireworks. This was achieved using an array to track particle positions and lifespans, along with random color generation.

c)Color Randomization for Visual Variation:

To enhance the dynamic nature, I introduced random colors for each circle or particle. This creates a unique visual effect on every interaction, aligning with the random color changes in the Pinterest GIF inspiration.
random(0, 255) functions in the color settings enable this variation, ensuring each element has a unique appearance.

### 4.Changes Compared to Group Code
In comparison to the group code: Unique Expansion and Contraction Rhythm: My code introduces a time-driven pulsation effect for circles, whereas the group code does not include this rhythm.
Interactive Fireworks: My code includes a particle-based firework effect triggered by mouse clicks, adding interactivity that differs from the group's approach.

### 5.External Tools and Techniques
No external libraries or resources beyond the course materials and the p5.js library were used. All code was written using methods learned in class, including standard p5.js functions for rendering and managing interactive visual elements. *In this document, I use chat gpt to help me polish the language.
